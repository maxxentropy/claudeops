# Phase 2: Pattern Recognition Engine

## Objective
Build intelligent pattern detection to identify repeated command sequences and suggest optimizations.

## Dependencies
- Phase 1: Learning Store (requires `learning-store.js` and database schema)

## Deliverables
- [ ] Pattern recognition module
- [ ] Sequence analysis algorithm
- [ ] Command suggestion generator
- [ ] Integration with learning store
- [ ] Tests for pattern detection accuracy
- [ ] Performance benchmarks

## Technical Specifications

### Pattern Detection Algorithm
```javascript
class PatternRecognizer {
    constructor(learningStore) {
        this.store = learningStore;
        this.minPatternLength = 2;
        this.minFrequency = 3;
    }
    
    // Detect sequences of commands
    async detectPatterns(timeWindow = '7d') {
        const executions = await this.store.getExecutionsInWindow(timeWindow);
        const sequences = this.extractSequences(executions);
        return this.analyzeSequences(sequences);
    }
    
    // Generate command suggestions
    async suggestCommands(currentContext) {
        const patterns = await this.store.getFrequentPatterns();
        return this.matchPatternsToContext(patterns, currentContext);
    }
    
    // Real-time pattern matching
    async checkForPattern(recentCommands) {
        // Match against known patterns
        // Return confidence score and suggestion
    }
}
```

### Pattern Types to Detect
1. **Sequential Patterns**: `/fix` → `/test` → `/commit`
2. **Error Recovery**: Failed command → specific fix → success
3. **File-specific**: Commands always used with certain files
4. **Time-based**: Commands used at specific times/days

### Integration Points
- Hook into command execution flow
- Background analysis job (runs hourly)
- Real-time suggestion engine

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Detects patterns with 90% accuracy
- [ ] Generates relevant suggestions
- [ ] Pattern analysis completes in <5 seconds
- [ ] No false positives for suggestions
- [ ] Handles edge cases (single commands, no patterns)

## Context for Next Phase
Phase 3 will inject discovered patterns into command contexts, requiring:
- Fast pattern lookup by command type
- Confidence scoring for suggestions
- Context formatting for command injection
