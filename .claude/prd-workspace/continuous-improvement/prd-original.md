# Quick Requirements: Continuously Improving Claude System

**Date**: 2025-01-20  
**Author**: Claude + User  
**Status**: DRAFT

## Problem
Current slash command system is stateless - each execution starts fresh with no memory of past successes, failures, or team-specific patterns. Teams lose valuable knowledge and repeat the same investigations. Claude doesn't get smarter over time.

## Solution Approach
- Create persistent learning layer that tracks outcomes and patterns
- Build project-specific knowledge base from actual usage
- Implement metrics to prove value and guide improvements
- Enable progressive automation based on observed patterns
- Capture and surface team wisdom at the right moment

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Commands reference past similar issues and their solutions
- [ ] System suggests new commands based on repeated patterns
- [ ] Metrics dashboard shows time saved and incidents prevented
- [ ] Team knowledge is captured and retrievable
- [ ] Each project builds its own "smart context" over time
- [ ] Junior devs have access to senior engineer patterns

## Out of Scope
- Cross-organization knowledge sharing (privacy/security concerns)
- AI model fine-tuning (using prompt engineering instead)
- Real-time collaboration features
- Version control integration (separate feature)

## Implementation Notes

### Key Components Needed:
1. **Learning Store** - JSON/SQLite database per project storing:
   - Command executions with parameters
   - Outcomes (success/failure/time taken)
   - Patterns identified
   - Team knowledge entries

2. **Pattern Recognition** - Analyze sequences like:
   ```
   /fix → edit auth.js → /test → /commit
   (Repeated 5 times) → Suggest: /fix-auth command
   ```

3. **Context Injection** - Modify slash commands to:
   ```markdown
   <!-- INCLUDE: learning-store.md#SIMILAR_ISSUES -->
   <!-- INCLUDE: team-knowledge.md#RELEVANT_PATTERNS -->
   ```

4. **New Meta Commands:**
   - `/learn [pattern-name] [solution]` - Capture knowledge
   - `/metrics [timeframe]` - Show impact
   - `/suggest` - Recommend new commands
   - `/history [command]` - Show what worked before

### Technical Approach:
- Store data in `.claude/learning/` directory
- Each command logs execution context and outcome
- Background analysis identifies patterns
- Inject relevant history into command prompts

### Example Flow:
```bash
/fix cors error
> "Found 3 similar issues in history:
> - 2024-01-15: Fixed by adding localhost to allowed origins
> - 2024-01-20: Fixed by checking preflight headers
> Using Test Engineer persona with this context..."
```

### Risk Mitigation:
- Privacy: All learning data stays local to project
- Performance: Index by issue type for fast retrieval
- Accuracy: Include confidence scores on suggestions

This transforms Claude from a reliable executor to an evolving team member that compounds value over time.
