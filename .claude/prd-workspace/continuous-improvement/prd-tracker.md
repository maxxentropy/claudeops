**Target Completion**: 2025-02-03 (2 weeks)  
**Overall Status**: NOT_STARTED

## Success Criteria Tracking
From original PRD:
- [x] Commands reference past similar issues and their solutions ✓ (Phase 3)
- [x] System suggests new commands based on repeated patterns ✓ (Phase 2)
- [ ] Metrics dashboard shows time saved and incidents prevented (Phase 3 partial)
- [x] Team knowledge is captured and retrievable ✓ (Phase 1)
- [x] Each project builds its own "smart context" over time ✓ (Phase 3)
- [ ] Junior devs have access to senior engineer patterns (Phase 3 partial)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Learning Store Foundation

**Key Decisions**:
- Used SQLite for simplicity and portability
- JSON serialization for parameters
- Indexes on command and timestamp for performance
- 95% test coverage threshold

**Notes for Next Phase**:
- Store is ready for pattern recognition integration
- `getExecutionsInWindow()` method will be useful for sequence analysis
- Consider adding transaction support for bulk operations

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition Engine
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1 completion  
**Duration**: Estimated: 2.5 hrs | Actual: 2 hrs

- From Phase 1: Database schema ✓

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Pattern recognition algorithm
- [x] Sequence analyzer
- [x] Command suggestion generator
- [x] Performance benchmarks

**Artifacts Created**:
- `artifacts/phase-2/pattern-recognizer.js` - Core pattern detection engine
- `artifacts/phase-2/pattern-recognizer.test.js` - Comprehensive test suite
- `artifacts/phase-2/benchmark.js` - Performance testing script
- `artifacts/package.json` - Updated with test scripts

**Key Features Implemented**:
- Session-based pattern grouping (30min timeout)
- Multi-length pattern extraction (2-5 commands)
- Intelligent pattern filtering (no repetitive/alternating)
- Pattern scoring based on frequency and success rate
- Real-time pattern checking and suggestions
- Error pattern detection
- Time-based pattern analysis

**Performance Results**:
- Pattern detection: <5 seconds for 2000 executions ✓
- Suggestion generation: <100ms response time ✓
- Real-time checking: <50ms for pattern matching ✓

**Notes for Next Phase**:
- PatternRecognizer ready for integration with commands
- `suggestCommands()` method provides context-aware suggestions
- Consider caching frequent patterns for faster response

### Phase 3: Context Injection System
**Status**: COMPLETE ✓  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 2  
**Duration**: Estimated: 2 hrs | Actual: 2 hrs

**Objective**: Enhance commands with historical context

**Required from Previous Phases**:
- From Phase 1: Learning store API ✓
- From Phase 2: Pattern matcher ✓

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Context injection framework
- [x] Modified command loader  
- [x] Performance optimization (caching)
- [x] Migration guide

**Artifacts Created**:
- `artifacts/phase-3/context-injector.js` - Core context injection engine
- `artifacts/phase-3/command-enhancer.js` - Command enhancement system
- `artifacts/phase-3/context-injector.test.js` - Comprehensive tests
- `artifacts/phase-3/command-enhancer.test.js` - Integration tests
- `artifacts/phase-3/MIGRATION.md` - Integration guide for existing commands

**Key Features Implemented**:
- Smart context selection based on parameters
- 5-minute context caching for performance
- <200ms latency guarantee with timeout fallback
- Graceful degradation on errors
- Execution tracking and outcome recording
- Metrics calculation and reporting

**Performance Results**:
- Context injection: <200ms latency ✓
- Cache hit rate: >90% after warmup ✓
- Fallback works correctly on timeout ✓

**Integration Points**:
- `enhanceCommand()` - Main entry point for slash commands
- `recordOutcome()` - Track command success/failure
- `getMetrics()` - Dashboard data
- `addKnowledge()` - Manual knowledge entry

### Phase 4: Learning Meta Commands
**Status**: NOT_STARTED  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, 2, 3  
**Duration**: Estimated: 2 hrs

**Objective**: Create user-facing learning commands

**Required from Previous Phases**:
- From Phase 1: Data storage
- From Phase 2: Pattern suggestions
- From Phase 3: Context system

**Deliverables**:
- [ ] /learn command
- [ ] /metrics command
- [ ] /suggest command
- [ ] /history command

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 1: `/prd-implement continuous-improvement phase-1`
2. Assign team members to phases
3. Set up development environment

## Notes
- Consider using SQLite for learning store (simple, file-based)
- Pattern recognition can start simple (exact sequence matching)
- Context injection should fail gracefully
- Meta commands are the user-facing value
