# Context Prime Command

ðŸŽ¯ **COMMAND**: /context-prime | ðŸ“‹ **WORKFLOW**: Workflow | ðŸ‘¤ **PERSONAS**: Default

You are about to analyze and understand a software project comprehensively. Your goal is to build a complete mental model of the codebase.

Please perform the following steps:

1. **Project Structure Analysis**
   - List all directories and understand the project organization
   - Identify the main entry points
   - Map out the module/component structure
   - Note any configuration files

2. **Technology Stack Identification**
   - Programming languages used
   - Frameworks and major libraries
   - Build tools and package managers
   - Testing frameworks

3. **Architecture Overview**
   - Identify architectural patterns (MVC, MVVM, Clean Architecture, etc.)
   - Map data flow through the application
   - Identify external dependencies and integrations
   - Note any microservices or modular boundaries

4. **Key Components Deep Dive**
   - Core business logic locations
   - Data models and database schema
   - API endpoints or service interfaces
   - Authentication and authorization implementation

5. **Development Workflow**
   - Build and run commands
   - Test execution procedures
   - Deployment processes
   - Development environment setup

6. **Code Quality Indicators**
   - Testing coverage and strategies
   - Code organization patterns
   - Error handling approaches
   - Logging and monitoring

After analyzing, provide a concise summary including:
- Project purpose and main features
- Key technical decisions and trade-offs
- Areas of complexity or technical debt
- Suggested starting points for common tasks

This comprehensive understanding will serve as the foundation for all subsequent interactions with this codebase.
