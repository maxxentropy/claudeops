# Phase 2 Implementation Summary: Consistent Slash Command Paths

## Overview

Phase 2 has been successfully completed. All slash commands now use consistent repository-relative paths through the path resolution system implemented in Phase 1.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Updated Slash Commands

The following commands were updated to use path resolution:

#### PRD Commands
- `/prd` - Formal Product Requirements Document
- `/prdq` - Quick Product Requirements
- `/prd-implement` - Execute PRD Phase with Full Context
- `/prd-preview` - Preview Integration Changes
- `/prd-kickstart` - Kickstart PRD Implementation
- `/prd-parallel` - Parallel PRD Execution

#### Generation Commands
- `/create-docs` - Documentation generation

### 2. Key Changes Made

1. **Removed hardcoded paths**: All `${REPO_ROOT}` references were removed
2. **Added implementation notes**: Each command now includes Python code showing how to use the path resolver
3. **Updated documentation**: Commands now clearly state that paths are automatically resolved
4. **Consistent messaging**: All commands use the same format for path resolution notes

### 3. Path Resolution Hook

Created a path resolution hook (`/hooks/path_resolution_hook.py`) that can be used to inject path context into commands at runtime.

### 4. Testing Infrastructure

Created comprehensive tests (`/tests/test_path_resolution_commands.py`) that verify:
- Path resolution from subdirectories
- Environment variable override (`CLAUDE_OUTPUT_ROOT`)
- Fallback behavior when not in a git repository
- Output formatting consistency

### 5. Documentation

Created detailed documentation:
- `/docs/PATH_RESOLUTION_GUIDE.md` - Complete guide for using path resolution in commands

## How It Works

When a user runs a command like `/prd my-feature` from any directory:

1. The system detects the repository root using `repo_detector`
2. Paths like `docs/prds/` are resolved relative to the repository root
3. Files are created in consistent locations regardless of working directory
4. If not in a repository, paths resolve from the current directory
5. The `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_ROOT` environment variable can override the detected root

## Example Usage

From any subdirectory:
```bash
cd src/components/widget
claude "/prd widget-enhancement"
```

Results in:
- PRD saved to: `{repo_root}/docs/prds/2025-01-21-widget-enhancement.md`
- Workspace created: `{repo_root}/.claude/prd-workspace/widget-enhancement/`

## Testing Results

All tests pass successfully:
- ✓ Repository root detected correctly from subdirectory
- ✓ PRD path resolves to repository root
- ✓ Workspace path resolves correctly
- ✓ CLAUDE_OUTPUT_ROOT override detected
- ✓ Paths use override directory
- ✓ Correctly detected not in repository
- ✓ Paths fall back to current directory
- ✓ Output formatting works correctly
- ✓ All path types resolve correctly

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Files always go to the same location regardless of working directory
2. **Predictability**: Users know exactly where files will be created
3. **Flexibility**: Environment variable allows custom output locations
4. **Backwards Compatible**: Commands still work outside git repositories

## Next Steps

While Phase 2 is complete, future improvements could include:
- Adding path resolution to more commands as they're created
- Creating a command to show current path resolution settings
- Adding support for project-specific path overrides in a config file

## Verification

To verify the implementation:

1. Navigate to any subdirectory in your repository
2. Run a command like `/prdq test-feature`
3. Check that files were created at the repository root, not in the current directory
4. Test with `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_ROOT=/tmp/test` to verify override works

The implementation ensures that all slash commands now have consistent, predictable output locations.
