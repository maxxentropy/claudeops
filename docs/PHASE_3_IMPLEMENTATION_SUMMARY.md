# Phase 3 Implementation Summary: Consistent Slash Command Paths

## Overview

Phase 3 extends the path resolution system to additional slash commands and adds new features for better path management and transparency.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Extended Path Resolution to More Commands

The following commands were updated to use the path resolution system:

#### Test Generation Commands
- `/test` - Test file generation with repository-relative paths
- `/tdd` - Test-driven development workflow with consistent test locations

#### Code Generation Commands  
- `/api-crud` - REST API generation with organized file structure
- `/mobile-scaffold` - Mobile app scaffolding with modular paths

### 2. New /path-info Command

Created a new diagnostic command that displays:
- Current repository root detection
- Active path overrides (environment and project-specific)
- Where each type of file will be created
- Status of configured directories

Location: `/Users/sean/.claude/commands/core/path-info.md`

### 3. Project-Specific Path Overrides

Enhanced the path resolution system to support `.claude-paths.json` files:

- Automatically loaded from repository root
- Allows per-project customization of output paths
- Example configuration provided at `.claude-paths.json.example`
- Gracefully handles invalid JSON and unknown path types

#### Example .claude-paths.json:
```json
{
  "prds": "documentation/requirements",
  "prd_workspace": ".project/prd-workspace", 
  "docs": "documentation",
  "tests": "test",
  "lib": "src"
}
```

### 4. Enhanced PathResolver Class

Updated `/Users/sean/.claude/system/utils/path_resolver.py`:

- Added `_load_project_overrides()` method
- Automatic loading of project configuration
- Proper precedence: Environment > Project > Default
- Error handling for malformed configurations

### 5. Comprehensive Test Suite

Created `/Users/sean/.claude/tests/test_path_resolution_phase3.py` with tests for:

- Project override loading and validation
- Command-specific path resolution
- Environment variable precedence
- Error handling for invalid configurations
- Multiple path type resolution

## Key Features Added

### 1. Path Resolution in Commands

Each updated command now includes a "Path Resolution" section showing:
- Where files will be created
- Example Python implementation code
- Standard directory structure

### 2. Flexible Configuration

Three levels of path configuration:
1. **Default**: Built-in standard paths
2. **Project**: `.claude-paths.json` in repository root
3. **Environment**: `CLAUDE_OUTPUT_ROOT` override

### 3. Transparency

The `/path-info` command provides full visibility into:
- Which configuration level is active
- Exact paths where files will be created
- Whether directories exist or need creation

## Example Usage

### Using /path-info
```bash
claude /path-info
```

Output shows:
- Repository root: `/Users/sean/project`
- Current directory position
- Active overrides
- All path mappings

### Creating Project Overrides
```bash
# Create .claude-paths.json in repository root
{
  "tests": "spec",
  "lib": "src", 
  "docs": "documentation"
}
```

### Using Updated Commands
```bash
# From any subdirectory
cd src/components/widget

# Generate tests - goes to {repo_root}/tests/
claude "/test WidgetService"

# Create API - organized in {repo_root}/lib/
claude "/api-crud User"

# TDD workflow - tests in consistent location
claude "/tdd new-feature"
```

## Benefits

1. **Extended Coverage**: More commands now use consistent paths
2. **Project Flexibility**: Each project can define its own structure
3. **Better Visibility**: Users can see exactly where files will go
4. **Backward Compatible**: Existing functionality preserved

## Testing Results

All Phase 3 tests pass successfully:
- ✓ Project override loading
- ✓ Command path resolution for /test, /tdd, /api-crud, /mobile-scaffold
- ✓ Environment variable precedence
- ✓ Error handling for invalid configurations
- ✓ Multiple path type resolution in single session

## Future Improvements

While Phase 3 is complete, one enhancement remains for future work:
- Automatic path resolution injection via hooks (currently low priority)
- This would eliminate the need to manually update each command

## Migration Guide

For existing projects:
1. Run `/path-info` to see current path configuration
2. Optionally create `.claude-paths.json` to customize paths
3. All commands will automatically use the new paths

No changes needed for existing workflows - the system is fully backward compatible.
