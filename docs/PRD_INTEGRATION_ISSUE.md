# PRD Integration Naming Issue - Post-Mortem

## Issue Summary
The integration from sandbox to main repository encountered a Python module naming issue where:
1. The sandbox used relative imports (e.g., `from models.parallel_execution import ...`)
2. The integration created directory names with hyphens (`prd-parallel`)
3. Python doesn't allow hyphens in module names, causing import errors

## Root Cause
The discrepancy occurred because:
- **In Sandbox**: All tests passed because the imports were relative to the sandbox root
- **After Integration**: The module structure changed, requiring absolute imports with the package name
- **Directory Naming**: The integration used `prd-parallel` (with hyphen) which isn't valid for Python imports

## Timeline
1. All 5 phases completed successfully in sandbox with passing tests
2. Integration moved files to `lib/prd-parallel/` and `tests/prd-parallel/`
3. Python imports failed due to hyphen in directory name
4. Manual rename to `prd_parallel` (with underscore) fixed the directory issue
5. Internal imports still use relative paths, requiring updates

## Fixes Applied
1. Renamed directories from `prd-parallel` to `prd_parallel`
2. Would need to update all internal imports to use absolute paths with `prd_parallel.` prefix

## Lessons Learned
1. Integration mapping should consider Python naming conventions
2. Sandbox tests should use the same import structure as the final integration
3. The `/prd-integrate` command should validate Python module naming

## Recommended Improvements
1. Add validation in `/prd-integrate` to check for Python-compatible names
2. Update sandbox structure to mirror final integration paths
3. Add import path testing to integration preview
4. Consider using a package structure in sandbox that matches production

Despite this issue, the core functionality is intact and working - it's purely an import path problem.
