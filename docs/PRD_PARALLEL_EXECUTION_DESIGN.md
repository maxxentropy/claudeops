# PRD Workflow Parallel Agent Execution Design

## Executive Summary

This design enhances the existing PRD workflow system to support parallel execution of independent phases using multiple Claude agents. The system automatically analyzes phase dependencies, spawns parallel agents for non-dependent work, coordinates artifact sharing, and merges results - significantly reducing total implementation time while maintaining quality and context integrity.

## 1. Dependency Graph Analysis

### 1.1 Dependency Detection Algorithm

The system analyzes phase specifications to build a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependencies:

```markdown
# Phase Dependency Structure
phases:
  phase-1-foundation:
    dependencies: []
    outputs: [models.js, schema.sql, migrations/]
    
  phase-2-core-logic:
    dependencies: [phase-1-foundation]
    requires: [models.js, schema.sql]
    outputs: [auth-service.js, jwt-handler.js]
    
  phase-3-api-endpoints:
    dependencies: [phase-1-foundation, phase-2-core-logic]
    requires: [models.js, auth-service.js]
    outputs: [api/auth-routes.js, middleware/]
    
  phase-4-frontend:
    dependencies: [phase-3-api-endpoints]
    requires: [api/auth-routes.js]
    outputs: [components/, stores/]
    
  phase-5-admin-panel:
    dependencies: [phase-1-foundation]  # Only needs models!
    requires: [models.js]
    outputs: [admin/]
    
  phase-6-testing:
    dependencies: [phase-2-core-logic, phase-3-api-endpoints, phase-4-frontend, phase-5-admin-panel]
    requires: [*]  # Needs everything
    outputs: [tests/]
```

### 1.2 Parallel Execution Groups

Based on the dependency graph, phases are grouped into execution waves:

```yaml
execution_waves:
  wave_1:
    - phase-1-foundation  # Must complete first
    
  wave_2:
    - phase-2-core-logic  # Depends on phase-1
    - phase-5-admin-panel # Also depends on phase-1, can run parallel!
    
  wave_3:
    - phase-3-api-endpoints  # Depends on phase-2
    - phase-4-frontend       # Continue admin panel if needed
    
  wave_4:
    - phase-6-testing       # Final integration, needs all
```

### 1.3 Dependency Analysis Implementation

```bash
# New command: Analyze dependencies and suggest parallel execution
ccanalyze() {
    claude "/prd-analyze $1"
}

# Output:
# Project: user-auth
# Total phases: 6
# Sequential time: 8 hours
# Parallel time: 5 hours (37% reduction)
# 
# Execution plan:
# Wave 1 (1.5h): phase-1
# Wave 2 (2h):   phase-2 || phase-5  [PARALLEL]
# Wave 3 (1.5h): phase-3 || phase-4  [PARALLEL]
# Wave 4 (1h):   phase-6
```

## 2. Agent Spawning Mechanism

### 2.1 Parallel Execution Command Structure

```bash
# Sequential execution (current):
ccphase user-auth phase-1
ccphase user-auth phase-2

# Parallel execution (new):
ccparallel user-auth wave-2  # Spawns 2 agents
ccparallel user-auth auto     # Auto-determines optimal parallelization
```

### 2.2 Agent Spawning Implementation

```bash
# Shell function for parallel execution
ccparallel() {
    local project=$1
    local mode=$2
    
    if [[ "$mode" == "auto" ]]; then
        # Auto-analyze and execute
        claude "/prd-parallel-auto $project"
    else
        # Execute specific wave
        claude "/prd-parallel $project $mode"
    fi
}

# Behind the scenes, this:
# 1. Analyzes dependencies
# 2. Identifies parallel phases
# 3. Spawns multiple Claude sessions
# 4. Monitors progress
# 5. Merges results
```

### 2.3 Multi-Agent Coordination Protocol

```markdown
# Agent coordination file: .claude/prd-workspace/[project]/coordination.md

## Active Agents
- Agent-1: Working on phase-2-core-logic (PID: 12345)
  Started: 10:15 AM
  Status: Implementing JWT handler
  
- Agent-2: Working on phase-5-admin-panel (PID: 12346)
  Started: 10:15 AM
  Status: Creating admin CRUD interfaces

## Resource Locks
- models.js: READ (Agent-1, Agent-2)
- auth-service.js: WRITE (Agent-1)
- admin/: WRITE (Agent-2)

## Message Queue
- [10:16] Agent-1: Created auth-service.js base structure
- [10:18] Agent-2: Need User model interface - found in models.js
- [10:20] Agent-1: JWT implementation 50% complete
```

## 3. Coordination System

### 3.1 Artifact Sharing Protocol

```markdown
# Artifact Registry: .claude/prd-workspace/[project]/artifacts/registry.json

{
  "artifacts": {
    "phase-1/models.js": {
      "created": "2025-01-21T10:00:00Z",
      "creator": "Agent-0",
      "status": "complete",
      "readers": ["Agent-1", "Agent-2"],
      "checksum": "abc123..."
    },
    "phase-2/auth-service.js": {
      "created": "2025-01-21T10:30:00Z",
      "creator": "Agent-1",
      "status": "in-progress",
      "readers": [],
      "checksum": null
    }
  },
  "locks": {
    "auth-service.js": {
      "holder": "Agent-1",
      "acquired": "2025-01-21T10:25:00Z",
      "type": "write"
    }
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Conflict Avoidance

```markdown
# Conflict Prevention Rules

1. **Namespace Isolation**:
   - Each phase has dedicated output directory
   - No cross-phase file writes allowed
   - Shared reads from previous phase artifacts only

2. **Write Locks**:
   - Exclusive write locks per file
   - Lock timeout: 30 minutes
   - Automatic release on completion

3. **Coordination Commands**:
   ```bash
   # Agent checks before writing
   cclock acquire auth-service.js write
   # ... do work ...
   cclock release auth-service.js
   ```

4. **Merge Conflicts**:
   - Phases designed to avoid overlapping outputs
   - If conflict detected, coordinator agent resolves
   - Manual intervention fallback with clear instructions
```

## 4. Progress Tracking

### 4.1 Multi-Agent Progress Dashboard

```markdown
# Enhanced tracker: .claude/prd-workspace/[project]/prd-tracker-parallel.md

## Overall Progress
Total: 45% complete (3.5 of 8 hours)
Parallel speedup: 2.5 hours saved

## Active Execution

⏳ Wave 4: Phase 6 (requires all previous)

## Resource Utilization
- Active agents: 2/4 possible
- Memory usage: 45% (safe)
- Artifact storage: 125 MB
```

### 4.2 Real-time Monitoring

```bash
# Watch parallel execution progress
ccwatch() {
    while true; do
        clear
        claude "/prd-status $1 parallel"
        sleep 5
    done
}

# Usage: ccwatch user-auth
# Shows live updates of all parallel agents
```

## 5. Merge Strategy

### 5.1 Automatic Merge Process

```markdown
# Merge workflow when parallel phases complete

1. **Completion Detection**:
   - All agents in wave report completion
   - Artifacts verified present
   - Tests pass for each phase

2. **Artifact Consolidation**:
   ```
   artifacts/
   ├── phase-2/
   │   ├── auth-service.js
   │   └── jwt-handler.js
   ├── phase-5/
   │   ├── admin/
   │   └── admin-routes.js
   └── wave-2-merged/
       ├── manifest.json
       └── verification.log
   ```

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Automated compatibility checks
   - Cross-phase dependency validation
   - No namespace collisions
   - API contract verification

4. **Merge Report**:
   ```
   Wave 2 Merge Complete
   ✓ Phase 2: Core Logic - Success
   ✓ Phase 5: Admin Panel - Success
   ✓ Integration tests: Passed
   ✓ No conflicts detected
   
   Ready for Wave 3 execution
   ```
```

### 5.2 Conflict Resolution

```markdown
# If conflicts detected during merge

## Automatic Resolution
- Non-overlapping files: Auto-merge
- Config files: Merge arrays/objects
- Import statements: Combine and dedupe

## Manual Resolution Required
- Same function names in different phases
- Conflicting type definitions
- Database schema conflicts

## Resolution Workflow
1. Coordinator agent identifies conflict
2. Creates conflict report with context
3. Suggests resolution based on PRD
4. Human reviews and approves
5. Coordinator implements resolution
```

## 6. Example Implementation

### 6.1 E-commerce Platform PRD

- **Better resource utilization** with multiple agents
- **Improved developer experience** with parallel progress
- **Maintained quality** through coordination protocols
- **Flexibility** to run sequential when needed

### Considerations
- **Complexity**: More moving parts to manage
- **Debugging**: Harder to trace issues across parallel execution
- **Resource limits**: API rate limits may constrain parallelism
- **Coordination overhead**: ~5-10% overhead for coordination
- **Learning curve**: Teams need training on parallel workflow

## 9. Conclusion

This parallel execution design transforms the PRD workflow from a sequential process into an intelligent, parallelized system that maintains all the benefits of the original design while significantly reducing implementation time. The coordination protocols ensure safety and quality while the monitoring systems provide clear visibility into the parallel execution process.

The system is designed to be gradually adoptable - teams can start with sequential execution and move to parallel as they become comfortable with the workflow. The automatic dependency analysis ensures that parallelization is always safe and beneficial.
