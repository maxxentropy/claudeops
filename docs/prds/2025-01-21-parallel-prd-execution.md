## Quick Requirements: Parallel PRD Execution System

### Problem
Current PRD workflow executes phases sequentially, leading to longer implementation times when many phases could run independently. We need to analyze dependencies and execute non-conflicting phases in parallel to reduce total implementation time by 40-50%.

### Solution Approach
- Dependency analysis engine to parse PRD decompositions and identify independent phases
- Parallel execution orchestrator to spawn multiple agents simultaneously 
- Conflict detection system to prevent file/resource conflicts between agents
- Real-time monitoring dashboard showing progress of all parallel agents
- Wave-based execution grouping independent phases for concurrent processing

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Automatically analyze phase dependencies from existing PRD decompositions
- [ ] Group independent phases into parallel execution waves
- [ ] Spawn and manage multiple Claude agents executing different phases
- [ ] Prevent file conflicts through resource locking/coordination
- [ ] Display real-time progress of all parallel agents
- [ ] Achieve 40-50% reduction in total implementation time
- [ ] Maintain same quality/reliability as sequential execution

### Out of Scope
- Modifying existing PRD decomposition format
- Inter-agent communication beyond conflict prevention
- Automatic rollback of failed parallel executions
- Cost optimization for parallel API calls
- Complex dependency resolution algorithms (keep it simple)

### Implementation Notes
- Key files: Create new commands in `commands/workflow/` for parallel execution
- Modify `prd-implement.md` to support parallel mode flag
- Add dependency parser to analyze phase relationships in decompositions
- Use file locking mechanism to prevent concurrent edits
- Create monitoring UI using terminal-based progress bars
- Consider using process pools or async execution for agent spawning
- Store execution state in `.claude/prd-workspace/[feature]/parallel-state.json`
