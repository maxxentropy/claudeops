# Command Visibility Hook Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

The command visibility hook wasn't showing output even though hooks were properly loaded (validator hook worked).

### Root Cause
1. **Parallel Execution**: Multiple UserPromptSubmit hooks run in parallel, not sequentially
2. **Original Hook Design Flaw**: The original hook only printed to stderr with exit code 1, but didn't output JSON to stdout
3. **Race Condition**: By the time the visibility hook showed its stderr output, Claude had already started processing the original prompt

## Solution Implemented

Created `command_visibility_hook_v2.py` that:
1. **Outputs JSON to stdout** with a modified prompt that includes the visibility header
2. **Also prints to stderr** for immediate user visibility
3. **Exits with code 0** to indicate successful processing

### Key Changes:
- The hook now properly implements the UserPromptSubmit hook protocol
- It modifies the prompt to include the visibility information
- This ensures Claude sees the context even if stderr display has timing issues

## Testing Results

The new hook successfully:
- Shows the visibility header to the user (via stderr)
- Modifies the prompt to include the header for Claude to see
- Works correctly with the validator hook running in parallel

## Updated Configuration

settings.json now uses:
```json
"command": "python3 ~/.claude/hooks/command_visibility_hook_v2.py"
```

The hook properly displays:
- Command name
- Workflow description  
- Active personas
- Execution start message
