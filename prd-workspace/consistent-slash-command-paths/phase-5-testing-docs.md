# Phase 5: Testing & Documentation

## Objective
Add comprehensive tests for the new path resolution system and update all relevant documentation to reflect the new behavior.

## Dependencies
- All previous phases completed
- Updated commands from Phase 4

## Deliverables
- [ ] End-to-end test suite for path resolution
- [ ] Integration tests for all updated commands
- [ ] Updated command documentation
- [ ] User guide for new path behavior
- [ ] Migration guide for existing users

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 100% test coverage for path resolution code
- [ ] All edge cases tested
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains new behavior
- [ ] Examples provided for common scenarios
- [ ] No confusion for existing users

## Test Scenarios

### Unit Tests
- Repository detection in various directory structures
- Path resolution with different inputs
- Environment variable handling
- Cache behavior
- Thread safety

### Integration Tests
- Commands saving files from different locations
- Workspace creation and management
- Fallback behavior
- Error handling

### End-to-End Tests
- Complete PRD workflow from various directories
- Multi-phase implementation tracking
- Cross-command interactions

## Documentation Updates

### Command Documentation
- Update each command's markdown file
- Add notes about path behavior
- Include examples

### User Guides
- "Understanding Claude Code Paths" guide
- Migration guide for existing projects
- Troubleshooting common issues

### Developer Documentation
- How to use path resolver in new commands
- Best practices for file operations
- API reference for path utilities

## Migration Considerations
- Existing files in wrong locations
- Scripts that depend on old behavior
- CI/CD pipelines

## Context for Completion
After this phase, the consistent slash command paths feature will be fully implemented, tested, and documented.
