# Phase 1: Foundation & Core Models

## Overview
Build the foundational data structures and models that will support the entire parallel execution system. This phase establishes the core abstractions without any complex logic.

## Estimated Time: 1.5 hours

## Dependencies: None

## Objectives
1. Define dependency graph data structures
2. Create phase state models and enums
3. Build resource lock manager foundation
4. Establish configuration schemas

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. Core Data Structures (`models/parallel_execution.py`)
```python
# Define these core models:
- PhaseInfo: id, name, dependencies, outputs, estimated_time
- DependencyGraph: nodes (phases), edges (dependencies)
- ExecutionWave: wave_number, phases[], start_time, status
- ResourceLock: resource_path, owner_phase, lock_time, lock_type
```

### 2. State Management (`models/execution_state.py`)
```python
# Phase execution states:
- PhaseStatus enum: NOT_STARTED, QUEUED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED
- ExecutionState: phase_states{}, waves[], start_time, end_time
- AgentInfo: agent_id, assigned_phase, status, logs[]
```

### 3. Resource Lock Manager (`core/resource_manager.py`)
```python
# Basic locking infrastructure:
- FileLock class with acquire/release methods
- LockRegistry to track all active locks
- Lock conflict detection (basic version)
- Lock timeout handling
```

### 4. Configuration Schema (`config/parallel_config.py`)
```python
# Configuration for parallel execution:
- max_parallel_agents: int (default: 3)
- lock_timeout_seconds: int (default: 300)
- wave_delay_seconds: int (default: 5)
- conflict_retry_attempts: int (default: 3)
- monitoring_update_interval: int (default: 2)
```

## Expected Outputs

### Files to Create:
1. `/models/parallel_execution.py` - Core data models
2. `/models/execution_state.py` - State management models
3. `/core/resource_manager.py` - Resource locking foundation
4. `/config/parallel_config.py` - Configuration schema
5. `/tests/test_models.py` - Unit tests for all models

### Key Classes/Functions:
- `PhaseInfo`, `DependencyGraph`, `ExecutionWave`
- `PhaseStatus`, `ExecutionState`, `AgentInfo`
- `FileLock`, `LockRegistry`
- `ParallelExecutionConfig`

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All models have proper type hints and documentation
- [ ] Resource locks can be acquired and released
- [ ] State transitions are well-defined
- [ ] Configuration is easily extensible
- [ ] 100% test coverage for models

## Notes for Next Phase
Phase 2 will use these models to build the dependency analysis engine. Ensure all data structures are designed to support graph traversal and wave calculation algorithms.
