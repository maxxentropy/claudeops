## Quick Requirements: Parallel PRD Execution System

### Problem
Current PRD workflow executes phases sequentially, causing unnecessary delays when independent phases could run simultaneously. We need intelligent dependency analysis and parallel execution to reduce total implementation time by 40-50%.

### Solution Approach
- Dependency analyzer to parse PRD decompositions and build phase dependency graph
- Wave-based execution orchestrator grouping independent phases for parallel processing
- Multi-agent spawning system with coordination to prevent file/resource conflicts
- Real-time monitoring dashboard displaying progress of all parallel agents
- Automatic conflict resolution through resource locking and agent coordination

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Analyze phase dependencies from existing PRD decompositions automatically
- [ ] Group independent phases into optimal parallel execution waves
- [ ] Spawn multiple agents executing different phases concurrently
- [ ] Prevent conflicts through intelligent resource coordination
- [ ] Display real-time progress monitoring for all active agents
- [ ] Achieve 40-50% reduction in total implementation time
- [ ] Zero degradation in code quality or test coverage

### Out of Scope
- Modifying existing PRD decomposition format/structure
- Complex inter-agent communication protocols
- Automatic rollback mechanisms for failed executions
- API cost optimization strategies
- Machine learning for dependency prediction

### Implementation Notes
- Create new `prd-parallel.md` command in `commands/workflow/`
- Add `--parallel` flag to existing `prd-implement.md` command
- Build dependency parser using phase input/output analysis
- Implement file-level locking in `.claude/prd-workspace/[feature]/locks/`
- Use terminal UI library for multi-agent progress visualization
- Store parallel state in `.claude/prd-workspace/[feature]/parallel-state.json`
- Consider phase priorities and critical path optimization
