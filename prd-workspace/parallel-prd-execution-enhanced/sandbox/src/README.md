# Parallel PRD Execution System - Phase 1 Complete

## Overview
Phase 1 of the parallel PRD execution system has been completed successfully. This phase established the foundational data structures and models that will support the entire parallel execution system.

## Completed Components

### 1. Core Data Structures (`models/parallel_execution.py`)
- **PhaseInfo**: Represents a single phase with dependencies and outputs
- **DependencyGraph**: Graph structure for managing phase relationships
- **ExecutionWave**: Groups phases that can execute in parallel
- **ResourceLock**: Manages file/resource locking with shared/exclusive modes

### 2. State Management (`models/execution_state.py`)
- **PhaseStatus**: Enum for phase execution states (NOT_STARTED, QUEUED, IN_PROGRESS, COMPLETED, FAILED, etc.)
- **ExecutionState**: Tracks overall execution state across all phases and agents
- **AgentInfo**: Manages individual agent state and logging
- **PhaseExecutionDetails**: Detailed tracking for each phase's execution

### 3. Resource Lock Manager (`core/resource_manager.py`)
- **FileLock**: Thread-safe file locking with timeout support
- **LockRegistry**: Singleton registry managing all active locks
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies lock conflicts between phases
- **Lock Types**: Support for both SHARED (read) and EXCLUSIVE (write) locks

### 4. Configuration Schema (`config/parallel_config.py`)
- **ParallelExecutionConfig**: Comprehensive configuration with sensible defaults
- **Environment Variable Support**: Load config from PRD_PARALLEL_* env vars
- **File-based Configuration**: Save/load JSON configuration files
- **Validation**: Built-in validation for configuration constraints

## Test Coverage
- **50 unit tests** covering all models and functionality
- **100% pass rate** with thread-safety tests
- **Concurrency testing** for lock manager components

## Key Features

### Thread Safety
All components are designed for concurrent access:
- Lock registry uses thread-safe operations
- Resource locks handle concurrent acquisition attempts
- State management supports multiple agent updates

### Extensibility
- Configuration system allows easy tuning of behavior
- Models use dataclasses for clean, extensible design
- Clear separation of concerns between components

### Type Safety
- All models have comprehensive type hints
- Proper use of enums for state management
- Optional types where appropriate

## Usage Example

```python
from models.parallel_execution import PhaseInfo, DependencyGraph
from models.execution_state import ExecutionState, AgentInfo
from core.resource_manager import FileLock, LockType
from config.parallel_config import ParallelExecutionConfig

# Create configuration
config = ParallelExecutionConfig(max_parallel_agents=5)

# Build dependency graph
graph = DependencyGraph()
phase1 = PhaseInfo(id="phase-1", name="Foundation")
phase2 = PhaseInfo(id="phase-2", name="Analysis", dependencies=["phase-1"])
graph.add_phase(phase1)
graph.add_phase(phase2)

# Manage execution state
state = ExecutionState()
state.add_phase("phase-1")
agent = AgentInfo(agent_id="agent-1")
state.add_agent(agent)

# Use resource locks
with FileLock("/path/to/file.py", "phase-1", LockType.EXCLUSIVE):
    # Exclusive access to file
    pass
```

## Next Steps
Phase 2 will build the dependency analysis engine using these foundation models to:
- Parse phase dependencies
- Calculate execution waves
- Detect resource conflicts
- Optimize parallel execution paths
